## Deploy ðŸš€

In order to start deploy the project you need to have the project.
you can clone from the following url:
`https://gitlab.com/jalasoft-recruitment/recruitcrm`

note: All application properties files are already set to localhost and default ports. you only need to configure it if you running the services and databases in different servers or ports.

Note: Gradlew version should be 5.6.x or greater

### Backend

Follow this order of deployment when running the application:

1. Run Discovery service `(recruitcrm\bootcamps\Backend\discoveryservice)`.
2. Run Gateway service `(recruitcrm\bootcamps\Backend\gateway)`.
3. Run Authentication service `(recruitcrm\bootcamps\Backend\authentication)`.
4. Run Bootcamp service `(recruitcrm\bootcamps\Backend\bootcamp)`.
5. Run Applicant service `(recruitcrm\bootcamps\Backend\applicant)`.
6. Run Setting service `(recruitcrm\bootcamps\Backend\setting)`.

#### 1. Run Discovery service:

1. Open `recruitcrm\Backend\discoveryservice\src\main\resources\application.properties`
2. If required to change the host and port, configure services host and port on application.properties file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Enter to: `recruitcrm\Backend\discoveryservice`
4. Start with the following command `gradlew bootRun`

#### 2. Run Gateway service:

1. Open `recruitcrm\Backend\gateway\src\main\resources\application.properties`
2. If required to change the host and port, configure services host and port on application.properties file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Enter to: `recruitcrm\Backend\gateway`
4. Execute the command `gradlew bootRun`

#### 4. Run Authentication service:

1. Open `recruitcrm\Backend\authentication\src\main\resources\application.properties`
2. If required to change the host and port, configure services host and port on application.properties file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Configure PostgresSQL credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
4. Configure RabbitMQ credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
5. Enter to: `recruitcrm\Backend\authentication`
6. Execute the command `gradlew bootRun`

#### Token administration and generation.

For the generation of a token first is needed have an user to create it, to do it, you must
run the below end point, where {{environemnt}} is the host where you want create the token
...

##### CREATE USER ENDPOINT

POST = http://{{environment}}/createUserCredentials
BODY = {
"username":"jalasoft-User",
"role":"ROLE_ADMIN",
"firstname":"juan",
"lastname":"peres",
"email":"user@mail.com",
"password":"Kas20#P",
"comments":"",
"status":""
}

With this data you will create the user that you will need to create the token.

##### CREATE TOKEN ENDPOINT

POST = http://{{local}}/generateToken
BODY = {
"username":"jalasoft-User",
"password":"Kas20#P"
}

The result will be a token for example
eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqYWxhc29mdC1Vc2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNjQ4NzU3MzMxLCJpYXQiOjE2NDg3NDgzMzF9.sn0_tM4Icf7QI6skC7PfM7QpSogF69nGeFjIXC_i3gu7TsnD5vkX2VeMU0HDmP2GpsKd9_iKF9qKPBEQmaUl_Q

##### USING THE TOKEN

You need to add the token into the autorization like a bearer token

#### 5. Run Bootcamp service:

1. Open `recruitcrm\Backend\bootcamp\src\main\resources\application.properties`
2. If required to change the host and port, configure services host and port on application.properties file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Configure PostgresSQL credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
4. Configure RabbitMQ credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
5. Enter to: `recruitcrm\Backend\bootcamp`
6. Execute the command `gradlew bootRun`
7. After service is up and running, optionally you can fill database with some default and testing data, to do it, run the next command: `gradlew insertMandatoryData insertTestData` 

#### 6. Run Applicant service:

1. Open `recruitcrm\Backend\applicant\src\main\resources\application.properties`
2. If required to change the host and port, configure services host and port on application.properties file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Configure MongoDB credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
4. Configure RabbitMQ credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
5. Enter to: `recruitcrm\Backend\applicant`
6. Execute the command `gradlew bootRun`

#### 7. Run Setting service:

1. Open `recruitcrm\Backend\setting\src\main\resources\application.properties`
2. If required to change the host and port, configure services host and port on application.properties file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Configure MongoDB credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
4. Configure MongoDB credentials, host, and port on application.properties file.
5. Enter to: `recruitcrm\Backend\setting`
6. Execute the command `gradlew bootRun`

#### 8. Verify the services are running.

In order to see the services that are running correctly you can enter to:
`http://localhost:9091/` and you should see a welcome screen from the discovery service.
**Under Instances currently registered with Eureka you must see: the gateway, bootcamp and applicant services running.**

### Frontend

1. Open `recruitcrm\Frontend\.env`
2. If required to change the host and port, put host and port of Gateway servicies on .env file, otherwise leave as default.
3. Move to: `recruitcrm\Frontend\`
4. Install dependencies with: `npm install`

#### Some few useful commands:

- Run the application: `npm start `
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Show the documentation of the components: `npm run storybook`

## Documentation

### Debugging runner

To access to Docker containers using SSH, you should ask for the PrivateKey

#### For windows:

1. Download MobaXTerm
2. Create a new ssh session
3. Configure the ip of the machine 10.24.48.123 (This is only accessible from the jala vpn)
4. link the private ssh key in the mobaxterm ui
5. Connect as ubuntu user no password

#### For Linux:

1. ssh ubuntu@10.24.48.123 -i path/to/private/key

### Gitlab Cache

- The gitlab runner cache configuration: There is a global cache for all branches, jobs and pipelines.

- Issue: There is issue when removing dependencies and also 2 or more branches are running the same jobs in parallel.

- Recommendation: When removing dependencies on a branch and it is running jobs, let it finish before running other jobs in other branches.
